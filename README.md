# Heart-Disease
A Machine Learning Approach to classify patients with Heart disease and those without.

# Rationale
LoanAnalytics Inc. faces the challenge of
managing the rising risk of loan defaults, which
has grown due to the expansion of the lending
industry and increasing economic uncertainties.
■ Traditional evaluation systems relying on static
borrower information (e.g., credit scores and
income) are insufficient to provide a complete
risk profile.
■ An advanced, data-driven approach is required to
accurately assess default risks, minimize financial
losses, and enhance operational efficiency.

# Objectives
The project aims to:
○ Predict Borrower Default Risk:
■ Develop a machine learning algorithm that utilizes historical
borrower data to predict the likelihood of default.
○ Improve Loan Approval Efficiency:
■ Streamline the loan approval process by incorporating predictive
insights, reducing human intervention, and cutting down processing
time.
○ Minimize Financial Losses:
■ Accurately identify high-risk borrowers to mitigate losses by
implementing strategies like adjusted interest rates or requiring
additional collateral.
